# Roll-A-Ball
Simple game made via Unity

Following Unity's tutorial, I created a simple roll a ball game. Here, you use the directional arrows on your keyboard to move the ball. The goal is to collect all of the yellow boxes by rolling over them. There is a count of how many boxes you have picked up on the top left hand corner, collect 12 to win.
